<li>Producing the booking ID No provided earlier is mandatory to avail the car rental services by " I SQUARE TAXI ". If this is not done it entitles the driver to refuse service delivery without any liability to us.</li>
<li>When a customer produces the booking ID No provided to him it earlier, it implies that we have read and understood all terms and conditions mentioned herewith and agrees on all of them.</li>
<li>The start and end distance in Kms will be calculated from travellers pickup place. Driving speed of the vehicle as per the directions of the local transport authority only.<span class="bold"> Parking charges, Toll charges, State Taxes and Entry Fees etc. to be paid by the customer.</span></li>
<li>Distances between two locations (points) be it an intercity distance or from travellers pickup place etc <span class="bold">mentioned on the website are approximate</span>. Actual distance may differ depending on the exact geographical location of the points under consideration.</li>
<li>Car air-conditioner<span class="bold"> will not work on hilly routes &amp; also when the vehicle is not in motion</span>. The customer is also not expected to request the driver to make the air condition operational in the aforementioned cases.</li>
<li>Any form of discounts are only applicable only on the basic fare and cannot be made available on extra charges like toll, taxes, charges on for extra Kms consumed if applicable, charges for extra hours consumed if applicable, driver allowance, parking, night charges, unless specified.</li>
<li>The vehicle booked will be subject to availability. In a case where the car booked is not available on the day of travel the customer will be provided with an <span class="bold">alternative equivalent vehicle</span> in the similar segment as applicable.</li>
<li>The customer can request for amendments to a booking made earlier by him only if the request is<span class="bold"> done 10 hours before the pick-up time</span>. No changes will be done within 10 hours of the time of pick up time. In cases where amendments are requested on cab type, the cab type requested is subject to availability. In case of a no show where the customer has not informed " I SQUARE TAXI " on the changes on his schedule 10 hours before the pick-up no refunds will be made. The amendments can be done by contacting the support team of " I SQUARE TAXI " on 9043-99-6699 and mention the booking ID No for references.</li>

<li>All bookings under consideration are on a calendar day basis i.e from <span class="bold">midnight 12:00 to midnight 12:00</span>. As an example for a cab booked for 4th July where the pick-up time is 4:00 p.m, the booking will be valid till 14th Apr 11:59 p.m and not 5th July 4:00 p.m.</li>
<li>Cabs that are booked for outstation (any or all of Oneway, round trip &amp; multicity) <span class="bold">cannot be used for local travel</span>. As an example if a customer books a cab from Chennai to Bangalore then to Nandi Hills and back to Chennai for a period of 3 days in total &amp; has a predefined Km limit of 800 Kms and he returns back to Chennai on the second day &amp; has a balance Km limit of 50 with one day remaining, in spite of this he is not entitled to consume this 50Kms for local travel in Chennai (From city), however the customer can travel from Chennai to some other city outside city limits of Chennai (say Chengalpet) &amp; consume the remaining 50 Kms or more than this by paying additional charges.</li>
<li>If needed, a customer can amend his booking from one way to round trip or from one way to multi-city while his travel is in progress.

<li>For all travel types (one way, round trip) customer has to bear all extra charges like driver allowance, toll, taxes, charges on for extra Kms consumed if applicable, charges for extra hours consumed if applicable, parking charges, night charges and any other charges applicable as <span class="bold">mentioned at the time of booking.</span></li>
<li>For one way outstation trips the customer will pay for any additional charges in the case where the driver needs to cover the additional distance (or) needs additional duration to complete his return journey (whichever of these two higher).</li>
<li>Transfers with unspecified distance coverage will only include one-way transfer either from airport or railway station to a single location or vice versa. Pick-ups or drops from multiple locations are not included in such bookings.</li>
<li>" I SQUARE TAXI " cannot be held accountable for any delay or consequential loss caused to the customer due to traffic jam or reasons beyond the reasonable control of the driver or lapses on the part of the driver.</li>
<li>" I SQUARE TAXI " cannot be held accountable for any loss, damage, physical injury etc suffered by the customer while availing its services.</li>
